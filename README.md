- How to download the latest build of the antinazi.org website for viewing anytime, with or without an internet connection.

***

 - 1) Download an archive of the latest version : find all build versions above the repo, along with every git tag.
 - 2) Unpack the downloaded archive using your tool of choice. Most file managers on iOS have that function built in.
 - 3) In the folder labeled "public", you'll find a file named index.html. Use your file manager (even Apple's Files App) to share the file to your notepad.
 - 4) In the folder labeled "lit", you'll find a file also named index.html; follow the steps in #3.
 - 5) To read either the main page or the literature page offline, tap on either file that was placed on your notepad in steps 3 & 4.
