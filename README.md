#### https://antinazi.org/ | antiNazi PWA

*   **antiNazi** is 100% offline capable;

### • How to read offline on mobile & desktop:

* * *

*   1) Open `https://antinazi.org` in Safari iOS / iPadOS;

*   2) Using the share function (the arrrow in the center of the address bar), add `antiNazi.org` to the homescreen;

*   3) The PWA that was just "installed" via Safari is, of course, antiNazi. It's 100% offline capable, so one may read the included literature without a network connection whenever one feels like so doing;

*   4) Thank-you for choosing to read "antiNazi"! ♥️
