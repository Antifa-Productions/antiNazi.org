**antiNazi** is 100% offline capable! The PWA can be opened and read without a network connection after connecting one time via a network connection. After that point, its service worker handles fetching all necessary files.

• How to read offline on mobile & desktop:

---

- 1. Open `https://antinazi.org` in Safari iOS / iPadOS;

- 2. Using the share function (the arrrow in the center of the address bar), add `antiNazi.org` to the homescreen;

- 3. The PWA that was just "installed" via Safari is, of course, antiNazi. It's 100% offline capable, so one may read the included literature without a network connection whenever one feels like so doing;

- 4. Thank-you for choosing to read "antiNazi"!
